A set of random C programs, doing cool stuff

### animations-and-visuals
Messing around with text output in the console.

### string-tools
Making my own parsers and tools in the most difficult and inefficient way.

### parallel-computing-n-process-management
Some examples of managing processes, threads, inter-process-comunication and parallel computing.
Destined and tested mainly on Ubuntu 20.04 - some changes might have been made.
